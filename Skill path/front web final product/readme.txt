Hello my name is Tambazason Ando and this is my project.
I wanted to create a platform where people can buy and sell metaverse related products.

So let me present you the website :
- this is the home page it has two paragraph for introduction
- and then we have the Marketplace, this is a page where the users can add their own product
to sell, buy clicking to this button add product, but this feature is not finished
you can also search for products in this searchbar, you can filter by the name of the product but also 
by category
and if you click on purchase, it conduct you to the official website

- the next page is interactive experience again it is possible to filter and purchase
- and the last page is crypto : the idea here was to show the price of the assets in real time but i decided to
keep it simple and just put some random price here.

ok so what can I improve here : add product, and real time price.

And for the end, I want to clarify that this background is a video, not coded with css
