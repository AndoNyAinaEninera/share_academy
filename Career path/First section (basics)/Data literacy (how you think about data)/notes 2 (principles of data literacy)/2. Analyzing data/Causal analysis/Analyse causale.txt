« corrélation n'implique pas causalité »

Etude de cas :
- analyse causale et la theorie du cholera de Jon Snow


Causal analysis generally relies on carefully designed experiments, but we can 
sometimes also do causal analysis with observational data.

Replication, randomization, control and representative sample are key components
of good experimental design


Causal inference with observational data requires:

- Advanced techniques to identify a causal effect
- Meeting very strict conditions
- Appropriate statistical tests
