Tableau is an analytics platform.
This makes it the place users go to see and create presentable data charts, dashboards, and stories.
Any heavy modification or preparation of the data is generally done before it is viewed in Tableau.

Click on sheet at the bottom left to create a new workbook



Data Pane: Data fields from the active sheet/table of the data source appear here.

Columns and Rows Shelf: This is where we drag fields to create a visualization. We can drag a field into either shelf to construct the columns or rows of the table, respectively.

Marks Card: Here, we can choose the chart type and further stylize our viz with properties like color and size. We’ll learn more about this in the upcoming lessons.

Pages Shelf: Pages allow us to break the viz into a series of views with a different view on each page. We can think of flipping through views as advancing slides in a presentation.

Filters Shelf: We can use this shelf to filter out data we wish to include/exclude.


Show Me: This menu shows suggested possible visualization types based on the selected combination(s) of data.


Make a new sheet

New DashboardCombine multiple sheets into a single dashboard

New StoryCreate a story with a different sheet or dashboard on each page


With so many visualization options in Tableau, it can be easier to create nonsense than to create a meaningful viz.
And with the amount of data fields and marks available to us, it’s easy for the canvas to get overwhelmed or become incoherent.
So before jumping into Tableau, let’s take a step back and sketch out our viz on a piece of paper first.
