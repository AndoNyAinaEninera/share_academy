- Binnig data
As a data analyst or scientist, you will sometimes deal with numerical data that you would like to arrange into different categories.
For example, imagine you are looking at the ages of a set of individuals.
You might care more about the age category each person falls under (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, etc) than the exact age.
The process of transforming numerical variables into categorical counterparts is called “binning.


Binning data can be useful in many situations, whether it be to create more appealing visualizations or to improve a machine learning model.

In areas like machine learning, binning data can be helpful to improve the accuracy of predictive models by reducing the noise of the data.
For example, if you’re a machine learning engineer working at an investment firm, you might use binning as a technique to improve your stock prediction models by smoothing the data to reduce the impact of small, short term price changes.

bins = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70] or bins = 5
dance_class['binned_age'] = pd.cut(dance_class['Age'], bins, labels=[])



- Combining categorical data
mask = election_data.isin(votes[votes < 200].index)
election_data[mask] = 'Other'
print(election_data['Vote'].value_counts())
