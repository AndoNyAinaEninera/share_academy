- Probability
(You can think any probability problem like taking balls or value from a box with a particular probability distribution, repeated an infinite amount of time)

- Set theory
(as set is a collection of items, each element in a set is distinct, the elements in a set are in no particular order)
(Union, Intersection, Complement)
(Venn diagram)

- Sample spaces and event

- Law of large number
(As we flip both coins more and more, the observed proportion of times each event occurs will converge to its true probability)


P(A∪B) == P(A or B)
P(A∩B) == P(A and B)

- Independence and dependance
(test d'independence if P(A∪B) = P(A) * P(B))
(tree diagram is useful to represent dependent probabilities)
(conditional probabilities (P(A∣B) = P(A∩B) / P(A))

- Mutually exclusive events and not mutually exclusive event

- Addition rule *union* (ex : P(A or B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A and B))
- Multipication rule *simultanous event* (ex : P(A and B)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A))


- Bayes theorem
P(A|B) = P(A)  * P(B|A)  / P(B)
