- Bernoulli distribution (1 trial, 2 possible outcomes) variance = p(1-p), E(X) = p, X ~ Bernoulli (p)
- Binomial distribution (n trials, 2 possible outcomes) variance = np(1-p), E(X) = np, X ~ Binomial (n, p)


- Poisson distribution (frequency of an event to happen in a specific amount of time) X ~ Poisson (λ)
variance = mean = λ = np
. a poisson variable is a count of number of occurence of an independant event, the eventsare occuring randomly and independently and does not change through time
. the probability of success is very small and many trials

Relation between Poisson and Binomial
. The Binomial distribution tends to a Poisson distribution when n->∞ and p->0
the more n is large and p tend to 0, the more binomial distribution tend to poisson distribution

- Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete variable



- Normal distribution X ~ Normal (μ, σ)
- Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous variable (only work for intervals, not a single point)

- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- Probability Point Function (PPF) inverse of CDF



- Distribution : uniform, unimodal, binomial, normal, skewed, bimodal, multimodal (Parfois, des distributions bimodales se produisent lorsqu'il existe des differences entre les categories d'une autre variable, the dataset has 2 different population)

print(home_prices.skew()) (Generally, if skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the distribution is highly skewed.)


===Properties of Expectations===
E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)
E(aX)=aE(X)
E(X+a)=E(X)+a

===Properties of Variance===
Var(X+a)=Var(X)
Var(aX)=a**2Var(X)
Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)
