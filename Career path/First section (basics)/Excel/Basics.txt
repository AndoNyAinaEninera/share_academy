- Cells
- computation on cells (using = sign)
- Select range of cells (B1:C4)
- =MAX(B2:B7), =MIN(B2:B7), =AVERAGE(B2:B7)
- Drag formulas
by default, excel will drag formula following the same path (same number of row/column deplacement)
example : C2=B2/B5 => C3 becomes C3=B3/B6

to place a reference cell : use $
example : C3=B3/$B$5 ($B to place column, $5 to place row)

- Errors #DIV/0! (for 0 in denominator) #VALUE! (for non numeric value)

to place for a reference in another sheet we use exclamation !

- Sorting data, sort by multiple column
The way Excel deals with cells that have the same value is by maintaining the order they were already in.
Since we’ve already sorted by date from newest to oldest, the 2/5/20 row for AL will come before the 1/11/20 row
