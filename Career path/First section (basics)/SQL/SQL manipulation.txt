The data is usually structured into tables

Manipulation :

- SELECT * FROM table_name;
- SELECT column_name FROM table_name;


- CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type CONSTRAINT, 
   column_2 data_type CONSTRAINT, 
   column_3 data_type CONSTRAINT
);


- INSERT INTO celebs (column_1, column_2, column_3) 
  VALUES (value_column_1, value_column_2, value_column_3);

- ALTER TABLE celebs
  ADD COLUMN column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, ...;


- UPDATE table_name
  SET column_1 = value1, column_2 = value2, ...
  WHERE condition;

- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;



Querying :

- DISTINCT
- WHERE, AND (displays a row if all the conditions are true), OR (displays a row if any condition is true)
- LIKE ("_", "%")
- IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
- BETWEEN (numbers, text or dates)
- ORDER BY, ORDER BY ... DESC
- LIMIT
- CASE (if logic)


Aggregate Functions :
- COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(), ROUND()
- GROUP BY
- HAVING (same as WHERE but for groups)
- Date and time manipulation https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html


Multiple tables :
- JOIN
- INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTTER) JOIN, RIGHT (OUTTER) JOIN, FULL (OUTTER) JOIN
- CROSS JOIN
- UNION
- WITH
